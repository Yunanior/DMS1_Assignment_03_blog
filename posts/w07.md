# Topoic choosing

![brainstoeming01](/w07s01/brainstorm.png)

**Begin**

At the beginning of the project, I decided to determine the general direction first. In this Brainstorm I listed the main  transitions in my life. 

And, finally “Live--death” been chose as the basic idea of this program.

**Develop**

After I dig into this topic, I found out the change of how I feel about the death of people around me is a good angle to build an environment. 

Before I experienced the death of the people I love, I thought death will bring people sadness, but after all the things happened, I realised the strongest feeling death brings to people is a sence of lost. 

**Result**

So in this project I will focus on showing the different stages of how I feel after my loved people passed away.

## Style and Sketching
**Style choosing**

Death not only can associate with collapse , but also can related with the peace and order. 

And these scenes inspired me a lot in the style choosing. 

![style 01](/w07s01/Style01.png)

This image is from the Game "NieR: Automata" scene 2, the visual style is really close to real life, but the models assessed in the environment also added some fantasy into it which make the scene had a good balance.

![style03](/w07s01/style03.png)

Theses screenshots come form the game "Graveyard Shift", in this tow scenes, the used of strong contrast and fog gave me deep impression.

This is the 3d environment created by BradleySmith “Remember The Fallen” , the single color tone is a good method to express the death and memory.

**Summarize**

In this project I will make the environment close to the real-life scene, and use simple color and develop the using of strong light in my environment. 

**Sketching**

![map](/w07s01/map.png)

The thought of map designing is, using the only pathway to guide the player, and the statures will been set in the middle of every important scenes. 

Also the map shows us how the scenes changing in this project. The player will start from a dock, and saw the cliffs and a room. Because there is only one way and the cliff hide the scenes behind it, player will walking through the only path, and see the graveyard. With the collapsed buildings with different angles will guide the playing walking forward and going through the bridge. After bridge, a statue setting in the middle of a small lake, and two paths ways guiding to two different positions. Player can walking on the pathway and going to develop what in both side.


**Color palette**

About the color choosing, i choosed signe tone, beacues is stable and fit with the topic Death an dLost.

## Assets choosing

**3D Model**

After the first guiding map been produce, I started founding the assets can been used in this project.

**Sound**

In this project, it will and a smooth and sad back ground music around the player, and maybe I will add the sound of walking and the environment voice like bird singing sound to make sure the scene is natural. Also, I may add the crying of people into the environment to show the first stage feeling of people's death.

## Basic Primitives

This basic primitive based on the map i prodused in last session task. And made a little bit change the make whole pathways more clear.
