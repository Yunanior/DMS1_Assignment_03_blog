**Begin**

At the beginning of the project, I decided to determine the general direction first. In this Brainstorm I listed the main  transitions in my life. 

And, finally “Live--death” been chose as the basic idea of this program.

**Develop**

After I dig into this topic, I found out the change of how I feel about the death of people around me is a good angle to build an environment. 

Before I experienced the death of the people I love, I thought death will bring people sadness, but after all the things happened, I realised the strongest feeling death brings to people is a sence of lost. 

**Result**

So in this project I will focus on showing the different stages of how I feel after my loved people passed away.
