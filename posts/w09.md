## Reflection

I asked my parents to help me test the game, it's turns out testing is very important. there's a lot of things need to fix.

This is the record of my father playing, and he going through the bridge correctly, but when my mother going though the place, she walking in to the tributary between the bridge and the mountain, so i raised the middle part of the tributary to make sure no one will get into the wrong place.

And another problem is the mesh of the mesh colliders of the house, it looks did't work in the testing, and after I fixed it, i let them test again and it turns out they can't get upstairs. I was confused and going to edit the problem. And I found out, it's the model problem, because the stairs model is connected with the columns and if I add the mesh collider, the player will been stuck in front of the stair, and if i move it, the stairs can't been used anymore, the player will fall down to the floor. So I gave up the thinking of going up stairs.

The last question is the water texture, after I output with the pubisher, it will turn into black, but I can't fix it, and hoping in the future I can have a good solution to fixed it.
