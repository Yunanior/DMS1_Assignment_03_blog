## Sound choosing

**Backgroung Music**

The reson I chose this sound is because is the rythem is ordered and powerful, and it can bring the player into the world easily.

**3D Sound**

I used to plan to put couple of sounds into the environment, like the crying, bird singing, sound of wind, but it turns out, there are too many sounds and feel annoy, even i trying to adjust the volume and place. And this result also can't express the peaceful and lost. So I just kept the sound of birds singing, to make the environment as simple as possible.
