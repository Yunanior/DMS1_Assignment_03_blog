Â At first, the crosses were put on the ground, in ordered. And suddenly I have a new idea about how to put these crosses, let them float. It actually is one sketch concept during the basic primitives been building---floating city. I want to use that as a symbol of the soul going up.

And in the first version, i changed all the buildings, the bridge and roads to Perfect 3D model, but i think the result is not following the theme. Because i want to make the whole environment pure, so the basic cube have kind of strong power to show it's a fantasy world which between the death and live, like the station in Harry Potter film. 

## Sound choosing

**Backgroung Music**

The reson I chose this sound is because is the rythem is ordered and powerful, and it can bring the player into the world easily.

**3D Sound**

I used to plan to put couple of sounds into the environment, like the crying, bird singing, sound of wind, but it turns out, there are too many sounds and feel annoy, even i trying to adjust the volume and place. And this result also can't express the peaceful and lost. So I just kept the sound of birds singing, to make the environment as simple as possible.
